# MLG-FluidDynamics

This repo is for our CS224W project — using Graph Neural Networks to simulate fluid dynamics based on DeepMind’s “Learning to Simulate Complex Physics” paper.

## Dataset generatin

We are using Taichi Elements (https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi_elements - required for running the code) to generate the datasets. 

The simulation runs multiple times, with varying initial parameters and the resaults are saved for training the model
