# MLG-FluidDynamics

This repo is for our CS224W project — using Graph Neural Networks to simulate fluid dynamics based on DeepMind’s “Learning to Simulate Complex Physics” paper. We are hoping to represent more real world events, from simulating oil spills in water, waves generated by falling icebergs to behaviour of water bound plastics.

## Dataset generating

We are using Taichi Elements (https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi_elements - required for running the code) to generate the datasets. 

The simulation runs multiple times, with varying initial parameters and the resaults are saved for training the model

## How to use our project

Open project.ipynb   

Run the cells  

If you want to run smaller datasets, please do this:  
Generate data and add it to folder temp/datasets/WaterDropNase. You should have a folder structure like this:  
<img width="258" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10012efb-4012-4b8e-bf26-50f37e4ccc96" />. 

💡 If you are time / space limited, you can skip test data for now and just copy the train data and rename it to valid.
