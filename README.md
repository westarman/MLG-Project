# Sustainable Forestry Planning with Graph Neural Networks

This project focuses on developing a GNN model to predict key attributes about the forest, based on the spatial information and metadata of the forest units in Slovenia.

The goal was to support a more efficient, consistent, and scalable preparation of forest management plans. By automating the estimation of selected attributes of forest units, the proposed approach can help identify anomalies, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall reliability of planning processes for future forest management initiatives.
