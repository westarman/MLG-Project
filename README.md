# MLG-FluidDynamics

This repo is for our CS224W project — using Graph Neural Networks to simulate fluid dynamics based on DeepMind’s “Learning to Simulate Complex Physics” paper.

## Milestone

Milestone requires both code and a short report draft (not every point is required).

### Code
- Processing the dataset  
- Training and evaluating the model  

### Report draft
- Problem description and motivation  
- Dataset description and processing  
- Model design and metrics  


## TODO General

- Set up working DeepMind fluid simulation dataset  
- Write simple dataset loader  

- Reproduce small baseline from DeepMind’s repo  
- Run minimal training steps on sample data  
- Implement a custom GNS version <- identify flaws and find improvements
